 Django-Orbited-Chat < http://github.com/lrvick/django-orbited-chat >

WHAT IS DJANGO-ORBITED-CHAT?
    A simple chat application I wrote in order to learn basic relationships
    between orbited, django and Stomp, with a bit of jquery to tie it 
    together.
    
    It probably will not see much future development but it is here for 
    anyone who wants to experiment with comet in Django 

CURRENT FEATURES:

 * Ability to store and view all chat messages

 * Simple Interface that fills the browser window of most browser sizes.

 * Uses Comet via Orbited/Stomp to scale to a large number of clients

NOTES

	This is by no means production-ready code. Do not actually use it in
	production unless you wish to be eaten by a grue.
